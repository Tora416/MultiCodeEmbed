# MultiCodeEmbed
*Multi-Dimension Code Embedding*‚Äî‚Äî
A three-dimensional degree code embedding tool that generates vectors in contextual, syntactic, and semantic dimensions, respectively. Based on [code2vec](https://github.com/dcoimbra/dx2021), [CodeBERT](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Code/Defect-detection) and [SBERT](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers).

This project was created to help **[Forsee](https://github.com/keepTheFlowerOfTime/Forsee)** process data.

## üìÑ Dataset
This project uses the dataset from the ***Forsee*** project, [Link to dataset](https://github.com/keepTheFlowerOfTime/Forsee/tree/main/dataset).

## üóÇÔ∏è Output Data

Some of the output files were so large that I put them in release, here is a list of those files.

### Results
The results are all `*.npy` files.

The project produced embeddings generated by the code2vec, SBERT, and CodeBERT models, each of which produced three files corresponding to the datasets in each of the three languages.

- **SBERT**:`{language}_SBERT_embeddings.npy`
- **CodeBERT** (using the pre-trained model directly):`{language}_CodeBERT_base_embeddings.npy`
- **CodeBERT** (using the fine-tuned model):`{language}_CodeBERT_embeddings.npy`
- **code2vec**:pass

### Fine-tuned weights (binary)

The project also provides trained fine-tuned weights for use in the CodeBERT model.

- **CodeBERT**Ôºö`{language}_model.bin`.It needs to be placed under the `./CodeBERT/code/saved_models/checkpoint-best-acc/`.
