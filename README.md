# MultiCodeEmbed
*Multi-Dimension Code Embedding*‚Äî‚Äî
A three-dimensional degree code embedding tool that generates vectors in contextual, syntactic, and semantic dimensions, respectively. Based on [code2vec](https://github.com/dcoimbra/dx2021), [CodeBERT](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Code/Defect-detection) and [SBERT](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers).

This project was created to help **[Forsee](https://github.com/keepTheFlowerOfTime/Forsee)** process data.

## üìÑ Dataset
This project uses the dataset from the ***Forsee*** project, [Link to dataset](https://github.com/keepTheFlowerOfTime/Forsee/tree/main/dataset).
